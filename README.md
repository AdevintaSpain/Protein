### Background

> *Protein:* A large molecule composed of one or more chains of amino acids in a specific order; the order is determined by the base sequence of nucleotides in the gene coding for the protein. Proteins are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the bodyâ€™s cells, tissues, and organs, and each protein has unique functions. Examples are hormones, enzymes, and antibodies.


This scientific definition defines quite good the objective of this Plugin in an abstract way.
For many time at Schibsted Spain we struggled with the idea of making a good and maintainable architecture for Android.
It's been some time until we got one that fits with our needs but we still have a lot of errors and issues that human beings do every time we make manual work.
That's were we came to the idea of automatization and make new components with all we need including tests, data sources even use cases and Presenters.

Protein is our approach to work better, be more productive and reliable.
